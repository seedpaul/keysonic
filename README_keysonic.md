# 🎹 KeySonic  
**Word Music – A playful interactive keyboard that turns typing into sound**

KeySonic is a browser-based musical playground where every keypress becomes sound.  
It blends typing, music, and animation into an expressive experience for kids, creatives, and curious minds.

## ✨ What is KeySonic?

KeySonic transforms your keyboard into a musical instrument:

- Every key press triggers a note
- Typed words become rhythmic melodies
- Visual feedback reinforces sound and motion
- Designed to feel fun, responsive, and a little magical

It’s less about music theory — and more about playful exploration.
